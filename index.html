                    <h3>When</h3>
                    <p>Saturday 3rd - Sunday 4th September 2016 (although the big day itself is Thursday 8th September, but you don't have to come to that)</p>

                    <h3>Where</h3>
                    <p>In glamorous Birmingham, of course! Plans are still in development, but it's likely to involve visits to a few of Brum's gems, both in the city centre and further afield.</p>

                    <h3>Who</h3>
                    <p>This handsome chap:</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/matt.jpg" class="avatar" />

                    <h3>Why</h3>
                    <p>Because 10,950 days ago (approx), Irene and Bob Andrews brought their only son into the world, and we should celebrate that fact.</p>
                </aside>

                <article class="item">
                    <h3>Haha, you're old Matt</h3>

                    <p>That's right, I'm old (or going to be). If you're reading this and you're older than 30, a) congratulations on having younger mates still, and b) please don't tell me "life begins at 30" or any of the other cliches. We both know it's all downhill after this.</p>

                    <p>Nah, in all seriousness I'm looking forward to it, or at least, looking forward to seeing lots of great friends, in my new adopted hometown of Birmingham.</p>

                    <h3>What's the plan?</h3>
                    <p>I'm still confirming aspects of it, some of which depend on getting an idea of how many people are coming, but here's the rough idea:</p>

                    <h4>Saturday 3rd September</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Morning/early afternoon: anyone nerdy enough can come along to the <a href="http://www.middleearthfestival.co.uk/">MIDDLE EARTH FESTIVAL</a>, a mile from my house.</li>
                        <li>Early evening: drinks at my house in Kings Heath (few miles from the city)</li>
                        <li>Evening: drinks at a yet-to-be-booked venue (ideally <a href="http://www.purecraftbars.com/">Purecraft</a>)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Sunday 4th September</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Morning/early afternoon: everyone who's still around can meet somewhere central for recovery full English breakfasts.</li>
                        <li>Rest of the day: exploring the charms of Brum (or you can go home, whatevs)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Okay, I'm up for it. Can I stay at yours?</h3>
                    <p>We do have a spare bedroom and a few inflatable beds (for the living room) &ndash; priority goes to folks travelling the furthest or single people who can't split a hotel bill, though. If you don't mind paying a little bit, I can recommend the <a href="https://nitenite.com/">nitenite</a> hotel in the centre of town which is cheap (Â£45ish) and has a bit of novelty to it. Otherwise, let me know if you need a room at my place and I'll see what we can do.</p>
                    <p>You could grab a train home on the night though if you don't fancy staying &ndash; Birmingham New Street is super well connected and not far from London, Nottingham, Manchester etc.</p>

                    <h3>What next?</h3>
                    <p>Please contact me (<a href="mailto:matt@mattandrews.info">matt@mattandrews.info</a> / 07533 953 151) to let me know if you can make it and what part(s) you're coming for!</p>
                    <p>Let me know ASAP so I can book things. No need for presents, if you're coming all the way here to see me that's generous enough! (note: Birmingham friends, this doesn't apply to you).</p>
